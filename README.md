# hide-it

**hide-it** is a simple fast and pure JavaScript / CSS 3 Splashscreen for modern Webbrowsers.

## Features

 * multi language support
 * ultra fast
 * no dependencies
 * adaptable
 * easy to theme

## How to use it

**don't link the files! include the content of the files as ```<script>```and ```<style>``` to achieve the best user experience**

 * Add the content off ```dist/hide-it.min.js``` at the end of your ```Ã¬ndex.html``` file inside a ```<script>```-Tag.
 * call Splashscreen init under this ```<script>```-Tag and provide splashscreen translations if needed
    ```javascript

    hide.config.language.de = {
      'title' : 'Herzlich Willkommen!'
      // todo
    };

    hide.config.language.es = {
      'title' : 'bienvenida'
      // [...]
    };

    hide.init();
    ```
 * Include the following HTML-snippet somewhere in your ```index.html```.
    ```html
    <div id="hide-it">
        <a href="#">Close</a>
        
        <div class="hide-wrapper">
          <h1 class="hide-title">The Title in your desired default language</h1>
          
          <div id="hide-loading-indicator">
            Loading...
          </div>

          <p class="hide-content">Content in your desired default language</p>

          <button class="hide-accept">Accept</button>
        </div>
      </div>
    ```
 * If you want to use the predefinied style include the ```dist/css/master.css``` after you compiled the Sass with your colors. Include the resulting css in your ```index.html``` inside a ```<style>```-Tag. Feel free to omit the ```dist/css/master.css```and write your own. Only the following css is really needed: 
       ```css
       #hide-it {
        position: fixed;
        top: 0;
        bottom: 0;
        left: 0;
        right: 0;

        z-index: 999;
      }
      ```

 * Trigger ```javascript hide.loaded()```if your application finished loading.


For a working example have a look at  ```example.html``` (in progress).
